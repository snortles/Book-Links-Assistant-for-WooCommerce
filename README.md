This plugin adds a dropdown on your product page to select your store for Amazon book links.

== Description ==

This plugin allows users to select their preferred Amazon store through a dropdown. When a user selects a store, they are redirected to the corresponding Amazon site. You will be able to select Amazon stores on a store by store basis on the edit product page. This is not an affiliate plugin, it uses clean, basic links that are are reliable and point directly to the product.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin.
>Go to your WordPress dashboard, 
>Navigate to "Plugins" >
>Click on "Add New" > 
>"Upload Plugin," 
>and select the `book-links-assistant.zip` .zip file to install.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== How to Use ==

Add the Amazon ASIN or ISBN to the SKU field in the Inventory tab in the WooCommerce section of your product page. Then click on External/Affiliate product and click the checkbox next to Amazon Book Link?.
Type in a heading that will appear above the dropdown list of stores on your published product page.  If you leave it blank it will say Available from Amazon.You can choose the style of the heading in the next box.
Make sure to keep the affiliate link section blank unless you want to create another external link, say to Barnes and Noble or you have one of those fancy, schmancy Books2read links. 
If you use this plugin on Simple Product, you can use it at the same time as selling the book from your website. The add to cart box will appear ont he published pages. This has not been tested on my sites as I don't want to deal with transactions and have gone the linking way.
This plugin will NOT work with variable products.

Official stuff over.
Hello, my name is Ceri and I'm an author and creator like you. I was looking for a plugin where I could add amazon book links automatically without relying on third party services which charge a bomb for redirection services or for just a dropdown list! I couldn't find one that didn't want to charge me a monthly fee, which I really can't afford. So, I made my own. If you want to see it in action, take a look at http://myrddinpublishing.com where I used it first, or my own website https://cericlark.com.

This plugin is free for anyone that needs it to be because of financial constraints, but if you use it, find it useful and can afford to donate something, I've got a Ko-fi account to help pay for my coffee habit and feed my child and pay my bills. Probably don't have that in the right order. :)
